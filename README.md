# UVrays_SPFAnalysis
# UV Index to SPF Recommendation Model
This project builds a machine learning-based recommendation system that predicts the optimal SPF (Sun Protection Factor) level based on the UV index, skin type, and exposure duration. It helps users make smarter skincare decisions, especially during high UV periods or outdoor activities.

 # Project Goals
Understand the relationship between UV Index, skin sensitivity, and SPF.
Perform EDA to extract seasonal and skin-type trends.
Build a predictive model using regression techniques.
Evaluate model performance and visualize predictions.

### Dataset was manually curated using WHO UV index guidelines.

# Future Work
Integrate live UV Index API for real-time predictions
Build a web app using Streamlit or Flask
Expand dataset to include region-wise atmospheric data
